## üß† How Athena Thinks

### Agent States

1. **OBSERVE**: Monitors market conditions, gas prices, pool activity
2. **ANALYZE**: Processes data with historical context from memory
3. **DECIDE**: Evaluates opportunities and selects best strategy
4. **EXECUTE**: Performs on-chain transactions via CDP
5. **LEARN**: Updates memory with outcomes and discovered patterns

### Memory Categories

- **Market Intelligence**: Pool performance, gas patterns, volume trends
- **Strategy Performance**: Success rates, ROI by strategy type
- **Position Tracking**: Current holdings, historical P&L
- **Learned Patterns**: Discovered opportunities and market behaviors

## üìä Monitoring

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Check health
GET http://localhost:8000/health

# View 24h performance
GET http://localhost:8000/performance/24h

# Current positions
GET http://localhost:8000/positions

# Active strategies
GET http://localhost:8000/strategies/active

# Real-time updates
WS ws://localhost:8000/live
```

### Dashboard

Access the monitoring dashboard via API:
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **WebSocket Live Updates**: ws://localhost:8000/live

## üöÄ Deployment

### Google Cloud Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy
gcloud builds submit --config deployment/cloudbuild.yaml

# Check deployment
gcloud run services describe athena-agent

# View logs
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision"
```

### Infrastructure

- **Cloud Run**: Always-on container for agent
- **Firestore**: Persistent memory storage
- **Pub/Sub**: Event-driven architecture
- **Secret Manager**: Secure configuration
- **Cloud Scheduler**: Periodic maintenance tasks

## üîç Strategies

### Current Strategies

1. **Liquidity Provision**: Identifies high-yield pools and manages LP positions
2. **Arbitrage**: Detects and executes price discrepancies
3. **Yield Farming**: Optimizes reward claiming and compounding
4. **Vote Optimization**: Maximizes bribes through strategic voting
5. **Gas Optimization**: Executes during low-gas periods

### Learning Examples

```python
# Patterns Athena has discovered:
- "Gas prices drop 40% between 2-5 AM UTC"
- "New pools have 10x higher fees in first hour"
- "Bribes increase 60% before epoch changes"
- "Volume spikes precede major price movements"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- No private keys stored (CDP handles custody)
- All secrets in Google Secret Manager
- Read-only dashboard access
- Transaction limits and risk controls
- Automated security scanning

## üìà Performance

### Metrics Tracked

- Total profit (24h, 7d, 30d)
- Win rate by strategy
- Gas efficiency
- Learning rate (new patterns discovered)
- Uptime and reliability
