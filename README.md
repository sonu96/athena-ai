### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/athena-ai.git
cd athena-ai

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your GCP project ID

# Set up secrets (interactive)
python scripts/setup_secrets.py

# Run locally
python run.py
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Required environment variables
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# Required secrets (stored in Google Secret Manager)
- cdp-api-key         # CDP API Key ID
- cdp-api-secret      # CDP API Secret
- cdp-client-api-key  # CDP Client API Key for authenticated RPC
- google-api-key      # Google AI API key for Gemini

```

## üß† How Athena Thinks

### Agent States

1. **OBSERVE**: Monitors market conditions, gas prices, pool activity
2. **ANALYZE**: Processes data with historical context from memory
3. **DECIDE**: Evaluates opportunities and selects best strategy
4. **EXECUTE**: Performs on-chain transactions via CDP
5. **LEARN**: Updates memory with outcomes and discovered patterns

### Memory Categories

- **Market Intelligence**: Pool performance, gas patterns, volume trends
- **Gauge Emissions**: Real AERO emission rates and reward patterns
- **Volume Tracking**: Actual swap volumes from on-chain events
- **APR Analysis**: Fee APR vs emission APR breakdowns
- **Strategy Performance**: Success rates, ROI by strategy type
- **Position Tracking**: Current holdings, historical P&L
- **Learned Patterns**: Discovered opportunities and market behaviors

## üìä Monitoring

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Check health
GET http://localhost:8000/health

# View 24h performance
GET http://localhost:8000/performance/24h

# Current positions
GET http://localhost:8000/positions

# Active strategies
GET http://localhost:8000/strategies/active

# Real-time updates
WS ws://localhost:8000/live
```

### Dashboard

Access the monitoring dashboard via API:
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **WebSocket Live Updates**: ws://localhost:8000/live

## üöÄ Deployment

### Google Cloud Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy
gcloud builds submit --config deployment/cloudbuild.yaml

# Check deployment
gcloud run services describe athena-agent

# View logs
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision"
```

### Infrastructure

- **Cloud Run**: Always-on container for agent
- **Firestore**: Persistent memory storage
- **Pub/Sub**: Event-driven architecture
- **Secret Manager**: Secure configuration
- **Cloud Scheduler**: Periodic maintenance tasks

## üîç Strategies

### Current Strategies

1. **Liquidity Provision**: Identifies high-yield pools and manages LP positions
2. **Arbitrage**: Detects and executes price discrepancies
3. **Yield Farming**: Optimizes reward claiming and compounding
4. **Vote Optimization**: Maximizes bribes through strategic voting
5. **Gas Optimization**: Executes during low-gas periods

### Learning Examples

```python
# Patterns Athena has discovered:
- "Gas prices drop 40% between 2-5 AM UTC"
- "New pools have 10x higher fees in first hour"
- "Bribes increase 60% before epoch changes"
- "Volume spikes precede major price movements"
```

## üîß Aerodrome V2 Compatibility

Athena is fully compatible with Aerodrome V2 pools on Base. The agent:
- Automatically detects pool interfaces (V1 vs V2)
- Uses storage slot reading for pools that don't support standard interfaces
- Maintains a registry of verified pool addresses
- Handles different decimal configurations for various tokens

## üìä Real Data Collection

Athena now collects real market data instead of using estimates:

### Gauge Integration
- Reads AERO emission rates directly from gauge contracts
- Calculates accurate emission APR based on current rewards
- Monitors gauge total supply and reward distribution

### Event Monitoring
- Tracks actual swap volumes from on-chain events
- Monitors fee collection events for accurate fee APR
- Maintains hourly and daily volume history

### APR Calculation
- **Fee APR**: Calculated from real 24h volume and pool fees
- **Emission APR**: Based on actual AERO rewards from gauges
- **Total APR**: Sum of fee and emission components

### Example Data Flow
```python
# Real data collection pipeline
Pool Scanner ‚Üí Gauge Reader ‚Üí Get AERO emissions
             ‚Üí Event Monitor ‚Üí Track swap volumes
             ‚Üí Calculate real Fee APR from volume
             ‚Üí Store in memory with new categories
```
