# Athena AI Integration Status Report

## Summary
All major integrations are functional with some configuration notes. The agent successfully connects to GCP services, fetches blockchain data, and stores memories.

## Integration Status

### ✅ 1. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Status**: Fully operational
- **Components**:
  - Firestore: Connected and storing agent state
  - Secret Manager: Loading secrets successfully
  - Cloud Logging: Available for monitoring
- **Configuration**: Project ID: athena-defi-agent-1752635199

### ✅ 2. LangGraph LLM Agent
- **Status**: Operational with minor issues
- **Components**:
  - State machine: OBSERVE → ANALYZE → DECIDE → EXECUTE → LEARN
  - Google Gemini: Connected (using gemini-1.5-pro)
  - Emotional modeling: Working
- **Issues**: 
  - API server thread error (non-critical)
  - Agent continues to function without API

### ✅ 3. QuickNode Integration
- **Status**: Working with limitations
- **Current Setup**:
  - RPC endpoint: Connected to Base mainnet
  - Gas price queries: Working (0.02 Gwei)
  - Pool data: Fetching via Aerodrome API add-on
- **Issues Discovered**:
  - Initial RPC approach had contract interface mismatches
  - Aerodrome API provides data but APR values show as 0
  - TVL/Volume data needs conversion from wei format

### ✅ 4. Mem0 Memory System
- **Status**: Connected and functional
- **Components**:
  - API connection: Successful (HTTP 200)
  - Memory storage: Using `remember()` method
  - Categories: pool_analysis, observations, strategies
- **Notes**: Pro plan features available

### ✅ 5. Firestore Database
- **Status**: Fully operational
- **Collections**:
  - agent_state: Stores current agent state
  - pool_profiles: Individual pool behaviors
  - agent_memories: Stored observations
  - pool_metrics: Time-series data
- **All collections accessible and writable**

### ✅ 6. Coinbase AgentKit
- **Status**: Initialized and ready
- **Components**:
  - CDP credentials: Loaded from Secret Manager
  - Wallet: Configured (0x56073E79e8d40c05B9a6C775080A659f0654a6d0)
  - Transaction methods: Available for swaps, liquidity management

## Key Findings

### QuickNode Aerodrome API
The Aerodrome API add-on provides pool data but with limitations:
- Basic pool info is available at `/v1/pools`
- Detailed analytics at `/v1/pools/detailed`
- APR calculations show 0 (may need gauge data)
- TVL/Volume in wei format needs conversion

### Recommended Approach
Instead of raw RPC calls to contracts, use the QuickNode Aerodrome API:
```python
# Fetch pools with analytics
GET /addon/1051/v1/pools/detailed?limit=50&sort=tvl
```

### Data Processing Requirements
- Convert TVL/Volume from wei (divide by 1e18)
- Handle APR calculations separately if API returns 0
- Filter pools by minimum TVL ($1000+)

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper Aerodrome API scanner (completed)
2. Add APR calculation fallback if API returns 0
3. Set up continuous monitoring dashboard
4. Resolve dependency conflicts (low priority)

## Running the Agent
```bash
# Set environment
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=athena-defi-agent-1752635199

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the agent
python run_with_rpc.py
```

## Monitoring
- Agent logs: `tail -f agent_output.log`
- Integration health: `python monitor_integrations.py`
- API test: `python test_aerodrome_api.py`

## Conclusion
All integrations are functional. The main adjustment needed was switching from RPC contract calls to the QuickNode Aerodrome API for pool data. The agent can now:
- Monitor pool performance via API
- Store observations in Mem0
- Make decisions using LangGraph
- Execute trades with AgentKit
- Persist state in Firestore
